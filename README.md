OpenVQE: README
=======================

`OpenVQE` is an Open Source Variational Quantum Eigensolver extension of the Quantum Learning Machine to  Quantum Chemistry. It was developed based on the tools of `myqlm-fermion` 


It consists of two main modules as follows:

- UCC Family: this module consists of different classes and functions to generate the fermionic cluster operators (fermionic pool) and the  qubit pools and to get the optimized energies from VQE in the case of active and non-active orbital selections. For example, UCCSD, QUCCSD, UCCGSD, K-UpCCGSD, spin-complemented pair, etc.

- ADAPT: consists of two sub-modules which are: 
    - Fermionic-ADAPT: it contains functions that performs the fermionic ADAPT-VQE algorthmic steps  in the active and non-active space selections.
    - Qubit-ADAPT: it  contains functions that perform the Qubit ADAPT-VQE algorithmic steps calculation in the active and non-active space orbital selections.


Installation
--------------
### Prerequisites:
#### Install myqlm-fermion:
You can install the fermion module with pip directly from the internet (not supported for now):
```shell
pip install myqlm-fermion
```
or install from the sources directly :
```shell
git clone https://github.com/myQLM/myqlm-fermion.git
cd myqlm-fermion
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install .
```
### Install OpenVQE
install from the sources directly :
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Haidarmm/OpenVQE.git
git checkout update-ferm
cd OpenVQE
```
Move to the next section for getting started!
